# Set up Process 
Well, edit the __avocado/templates/*__ if you don't want to use the default theme.

Open __avocado/settings.py__ and edit:
- _SECRET_KEY_ to something random
- _BLOG_TITLE_ to whatever you want to call your blog
- _BLOG_DESC_ to whatever you want to describe your blog with
- _COPYRIGHT_ to the current year and your name or keep it blank to remove it
- _TWTTR_LNK_ to whatever your username is
- _GITHUB_LNK_ to whatever your username is
- _FB_LNK_ to whatever your username is
- _REDDIT_LNK_ to whatever your username is

Once you're done with the tasks above you're going to want to go read how to put a Django project in production.
Note :- Personally I just throw it in a screen session and forget about it - there's some other ways, but that's the quickest I've found. :)

# Features
- Markdown support
- Simple design system (everything is in their own html templates for ease of editing)
- Built in Python and with Django
- Lightweight

# Please Note
- Not in PHP
- Not a team of 100,000 devs so the code is rather clean and simple

# How to Contribute 
Well, sure - see [TODO.md](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/TODO.md) to see current tasks. I don't think it's necessary to make a full code of conduct on style of code etc just write good clean code. See [CONTRIBUTE.md](https://github.com/trdwll/avocado/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md)
